# javaUnitConverter

This application uses a very simple conversation concept to convert pounds to kilogram.
A variable to represent pound unit is created first.
Another variable is created and stored in the memory that uses a logic of conversation (1kg = 0.45359237 pound).
Finally, the stored variable is printed out which is the converted value in kilogram.
